                                <p>Cloud networking is a type of IT infrastructure in which some or all of an organizationâ€™s network capabilities and resources are hosted in a public or private cloud platform, managed in-house or by a service provider, and available on demand.</p>

                                <p>Businesses today turn to the cloud to drive agility, deliver differentiation, accelerate time-to-market, and increase scale. The cloud model has become the standard approach to build and deliver applications for the modern enterprise. </p>

                       <p>Cloud networking has also played a critical role in the way organizations address their growing infrastructure needs, regional expansions, and redundancy plans. Many organizations are adopting a multi-data center strategy and leveraging multiple clouds from multiple cloud service providers (CSPs).</p>
